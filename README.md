# Nitrogen_Life_Support_Modeling
Repository for Model Described in "Modeling approaches to nitrogen management   for food production in closed, life-support systems" (Wallentine, et. al)

This repository contains two codes that utilize the same model to perform two different analyses:
[1] Regiment_Compare.py: Compares five different nitrogen management regiments given the conditions specified by the user at the start of the code.
[2] Sensitivity_Analysis.py: Analyzes a single variable in the code, as specified by the user, and its effect on the overall system at varying efficiencies and performances.
